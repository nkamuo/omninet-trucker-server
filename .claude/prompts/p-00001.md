I need you to fully configure this Symfony application with api-platform.

create the basic roles that allows the users to submit their trucks, others to heir these truck.

They can provide images and other needed documents as well.


You can see the scaffolds of the entities attached below, create the matching entities, their repositories and make them full Api-Platform Resoruces.

Also, make sure to take advantage of the Symfony Security Bundle and protect the resources accordingly.

There might be need to add some custom endpoints for these entities(resources), if so,  use api processors and providers for this - not controller.
